## Deploying to Heroku

To deploy the Strapi instance you'll need:

- [An Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/) for free
- [A Cloudinary account for saving images](https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free) for free

Once you have created these accounts you can deploy your instance by clicking on this button.

> Tip ðŸ’¡: You can copy this repo first with the template button, and **then** click on the deploy link, in **your** clone's uploaded readme.md. 

> It will make things easier later, to sync your repo and the copy that Heroku mantains.
